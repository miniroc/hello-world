**********************口语*****************
雅思的P1部分要说足15秒，P3部分至少要说足25-30秒，最好都要说到考官叫停你为止，否则会被扣分。其实雅思口语考试考的是口语而不是逻辑，所以我如果实在无话可说的时候，就举自己的例子。
在考试的评判中其实流利度是占第一位的。所以我想说，大家不要因为要使用一些高难度的语法啊之类的，而影响自己的表达流利性。而且如果卡壳了的话尽量也不要额。。啊。。这样说，可以用一些比较自然的话来过渡，比如说，you know,I mean之类的，这样总比说不出来好。而且，如果自己如果意识到自己之前说错了，比如时态是过去时说成了现在进行时，不要再去纠正自己所说的，直接说下去就好了！ 

关于模板的问题，个人觉得你可以用一些高级的模板，但是你的正文材料必须表现出同样高级的东西出来，否则的话，用高级模板反而会引起考官的方案。其实我觉得作文的一些词汇也用不着及其高级，但是要让考官看到你的明确的思路在里面。个人建议可以准备几个万能句式，比如说我自己就一直喜欢用一个句式，一个虚拟语气的句式 if.....it had such merits, would there be no meaning to do XXX? By no means(从上面的范文里学来的），有时我不需要你有很多这种句子，一两句一两句足以令考官对你刮目相看了。 

blend in 融入,目的是不引人注目。
fit in 融入, 指被别人或团体接受。
Blend in 后面不能直接+名词，但可以加一个介词，比如：
	blend in with his friends 和他的朋友打成一片
	blend in with the crowd 混到人群中
fit in 后面不能直接+名词，但可以加一个介词。比如：
・ fit in with the group 融入团体
・ fit in at school 在学校合群
所以当我们想说“融入新公司/工作/团队”，可以这样表达：
	fit in at a new company
	fit in with a new company
	fit in at a new job
除了 fit in，我们还可以用 fit into 来表达融入。fit into 后面可以直接+名词

		Dear Anita,
		Best regards,
		Warm wishes,
3.Start the letter appropriately.
	a. Open a formal and semi-formal letter with a formal sentence and paragraph. Get down to business and say why you are writing. Don’t try to be friendly, as you do not know the person you are writing to.
	Formal:
		Dear Sir/Madam,
		I am writing to inquire about…
		I am writing in connection with…
	Semi-formal
		Dear Mr. Johnson,
		I am writing to inform you that…
		I am writing to…
	b. Open an informal letter with a general, friendly paragraph. Acknowledge your friendship first, before explaining the reason for your letter. In fact, the first paragraph could include just friendly small talk, unrelated to the reason for your writing.
		Dear Susan
		I hope you and your family are all well! It was so wonderful to spend time with all of you last month. It felt great to catch up with you and Bob, get to know your children, and have fun together after so long. You have always been dear friends of mine, and always will be. Anyway, the reason I’m writing is that I have some good news: I am getting married in September…
	How are things in New York? I hope you’re keeping cool during the heat wave.
	Hope your summer’s off to a great start. Is it vacation time yet?
	Hey, it’s Friday! I hope you have some cool plans for the weekend.
4. Divide your letter into paragraphs.
Usually you need four paragraphs:
	Introduction
	Problem / Situation
	Solution / Action
	Conclusion
In your letter, answer the points:
explain the problem
describe why it disturbs you
suggest a solution

Expressing concern

On some level the phrase is a cliche, but its a cliche for a reason: it is the best way of expressing your desired sententiment.
I regret to inform you that…
I am sorry to tell you that…

Giving good news
I am pleased to advise you that…
I am delighted to inform you that…

Body: 1st paragraph - strong argument for your side
	2nd paragraph - start with a concession, talk about side B, what are the good sides of side B, make sure it's short, make sure turn it back around and continue to argue your side简要提对方观点的优点，转折再argue your side

Non-opinion类型：
This essay will look at/discuss/
As this essay will demonstrate...
Paragraph one: Though there are several reasons, ___ seems to be the most obvious/pertinent/common/clear.
Body 1: reason 1 / advantage
Body 2: reason 2 / disadvantage
benefit, drawback, compare, contrast
don't give opinion, it's observation, it's obvious

Hybrid类型：Discuss both, give opinion
There are pros and cons to ...,  though I believe ...
Body 1: Discuss both, lean to choose
Body 2: support your choice, mention the other side


#############Write the introduction###########
-Plan first
-Translate this plan into 3~5 sentences
-Anser:
	-what is the topic
	-what is the question
	-what is your opinion
	-water is your reason
I believe/think/agree/In my opinion .. due to the fact that ...
(for non-opinion essay: )This essay will look at/discuss...

As a person reaches adulthood, he(he or she whatever it's OK, do not use he/she) needs to decide on where he prefer to live(The topic). While there are advantages to both living in the country and the city(The question), I believe that for economic reasons, life in the city is more beneficial(Your opinion). This is because the city offers more employment opportunities(reason 1), as well as more affordable cost of living(reason 2)
接下来一段写employment opportunities，第二段写cost of living

Do not copy the questions, paraphrase it ( changes the words, change the structure, keep the same meaning)
Synonyms替换
Sentence structure替换  verb ?> nouns ?> adjective, change order
Using concessions.

Eg. Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.
Schooling, essential
Although many would argue that the economy is the most important factor in nation building, I think education has a far greater impact.

############# write the paragraph ####################
-Indent or skip a line between paragraphs, but don't do both
-one central idea in one paragraph. Thesis statement in general.
-all other ideas directly related to main 
-any length, below 4~5 sentenses

In conclusion, ...
To conclude, ...
To Sum up, ...
To summarize, 
In summary, 
Thus, with the above in mind, .../ it is fair to conclude that ...

Dos: 
-Keep it short, 1~2 sentenses are enough
-Keep it simple - boring is  good
-Restate the thesis - opinion to opinion, outline to outline
-Restate the highlights - main points, resons/arguments
-Write a conclusion

Don'ts:
-Introducing new ideas - can't elaberate, confuse the reader, weaken the main argument
-Use a personal pronoun(I, me, my), 会比较弱，前面已经提到了I belive等观点，这里结尾用比较强的语气，强烈的结论。 It is true that .../no doubt that ...



####################写作词汇#############################
Arguments arise regards how to ...
Our society is polarized with regard to ...
polarized opinion
xxx is one of the most salient quality we seek to folster in our children.


ensue. 接踵而来If the Europeans did not reduce subsidies, a trade war would ensue.

on par with: equal to somone or something

Volatile: something unstable/negative in nature, changeable. The volatile nature of weather

hit Plateau: stability停滞不前，高峰. corn oil production hit plateau of 200 barrels

Pique: to describe something that stimulates interesting, arous, to provoke.  After visiting a science and technology museum, my interest in computer programming was piqued. Technology can pique the interest of students in a way that enourages focus and information retension.

Contrary. 
contrary to my personality, my sister is very outgoing and tend to make friends easily.
On the contrary, several ...

Parallel: Something accurs in the same manner; very similar and often happen in the same time.
several parallels exist between A and B

Embrace: something that is accepted willingly and can be used in one's advantage
I embrace the opportunity of studying abroad.

Retain: keep somebody in a position, job, and etc.
It make it difficult for people to retain their culture identity.

hinder C limit the ability of something.
weaken C cause something to be LESS strong
translate C change something into a new form
intensify C to become stronger
debate C to discuss in a formal way
conceive C imagine (could you conceive I’d give you a bonus verb!)
break C make known C the media broke the story of abandoning public transport last year
delegate C assign a task to
lobby C persuade C (especially in government)

HINDER C limit the ability of something.
Abandoning dated school buses would most likely hinder any efforts to improve road safety around schools, the main reason is that if each parent brings their own child, the traffic around schools would be horrendous.
Disregarding a detailed list of activities for a free day would most likely hinder any efforts to obtain the full potential of the said free day.

WEAKEN C cause something to be LESS strong
Abandoning dated school buses would most likely weaken any efforts to improve road safety around schools, the main reason is that if each parent brings their own child, the traffic around schools would be horrendous.
Disregarding a detailed list of activities for a free day would most likely weaken any efforts to obtain the full potential of the said free day.
Grammatically perfect but SOUNDS FORCED, and unnatural.

TRANSLATE C change something into a new form
Abandoning dated school buses would most likely translate into congested and dangerous roads around the school, furthermore the air quality could only worsen.
Disregarding a detailed list of activities for a free day would most likely translate into a sloppily organised day replete of spontaneous distractions and unforeseen costs.

INTENSIFY C to become stronger
Abandoning dated school buses would most likely intensify any road safety or pollution issues the school district might already be facing.
Disregarding a detailed list of activities for a free day would most likely intensify the chances the day descends into a sloppily organised event replete of spontaneous distractions and unforeseen costs.
Grammatically perfect but SOUNDS FORCED, and unnatural.

DEBATE C to discuss in a formal way
Those who debate in favour of abandoning school transport may have forgotten important issues such as air quality, road safety, and dual income families.
Again, not really suitable because there is no real debate, there is no issue, this is more a point of view. Whereas with the school bus issue, it’s easy to imagine a group of parents bickering at each other…
