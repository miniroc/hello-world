**********************口语*****************
雅思的P1部分要说足15秒，P3部分至少要说足25-30秒，最好都要说到考官叫停你为止，否则会被扣分。其实雅思口语考试考的是口语而不是逻辑，所以我如果实在无话可说的时候，就举自己的例子。
在考试的评判中其实流利度是占第一位的。所以我想说，大家不要因为要使用一些高难度的语法啊之类的，而影响自己的表达流利性。而且如果卡壳了的话尽量也不要额。。啊。。这样说，可以用一些比较自然的话来过渡，比如说，you know,I mean之类的，这样总比说不出来好。而且，如果自己如果意识到自己之前说错了，比如时态是过去时说成了现在进行时，不要再去纠正自己所说的，直接说下去就好了！ 

关于模板的问题，个人觉得你可以用一些高级的模板，但是你的正文材料必须表现出同样高级的东西出来，否则的话，用高级模板反而会引起考官的方案。其实我觉得作文的一些词汇也用不着及其高级，但是要让考官看到你的明确的思路在里面。个人建议可以准备几个万能句式，比如说我自己就一直喜欢用一个句式，一个虚拟语气的句式 if.....it had such merits, would there be no meaning to do XXX? By no means(从上面的范文里学来的），有时我不需要你有很多这种句子，一两句一两句足以令考官对你刮目相看了。
